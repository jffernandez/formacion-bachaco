**Pedro M. Baeza** is an Odoo freelance consultant, developer, and trainer with more than 16 years of experience in IT. He’s been in the Odoo world for 4 years, and has been
involved in its community since the beginning, first in the Spanish community, and then in the worldwide community that later formed the Odoo Community Association (OCA).
Currently, he is the Spanish localization PSC and website PSC team leader, and also an
active reviewer and contributor for most of the community projects.

He doesn’t have direct employees, but collaborates with other companies and freelancers
to deploy Odoo implementations. He feels that the best part of this is having to contact a lot of awesome people to work with to get to a common goal and that this is the perfect environment for getting close to perfection!

I would like to thank the awesome community, which is spread around the world, for
pushing me a little further and adding to my knowledge. I also want to thank my girlfriend (and future wife), Esther, for understanding why I’m unable to spend time with her because of the job and my current commitment to the community.

**Nicholas Bessi** has been an Odoo/OpenERP developer and consultant since 2006 when it
was still TinyERP. He is the author of many modules including the “report webkit” add-on
that was part of the official add-ons for many years, which inspired the actual QWeb
report engine.

He’s an active member of Odoo Community Association and is responsible for Swiss
localization. He was recognized as an OpenERP top contributor in 2010, and is still an
active partisan of Open Source values.

Nicholas is a technical leader at Camptocamp, a leading society in Open Source
technologies that is a historical Odoo contibutor and partner. Camtocamp is actively
working alongside Odoo to bring the solution to the next level.

**Alexandre Fayolle** installed his first Linux distribution in 1995 (Slackware at the time, before moving to Debian in 1996) and has never used another OS on his computers since. He started using Python in 1999 when he cofounded Logilab, where he was a CTO,
software architect, and Agile coach. He got the opportunity to participate in a large
number of FLOSS projects, including pyxml, Pypy, Cubicweb, and Pylint. In 2012, he
joined Camptocamp to work on Odoo, which was still called OpenERP at the time. He
became a very active member of the Odoo Community Association, both as a direct
module contributor and as a mentor to new comers. He also happens to be a jazz
vibraphone player.
